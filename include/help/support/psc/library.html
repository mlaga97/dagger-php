                         Health Screening Tool in Pediatric Primary Care</a><p><i>OBJECTIVE</i>: To evaluate how parents and physicians perceive the utility of a comprehensive, 
                         electronic previsit screener, and to assess its impact on the visit.
                         <i>METHODS</i>: A mixed methods design was used. English- speaking parents were recruited from 3 primary care systems (urban MD and rural NY and VT) 
                         when they presented for a well-child visit with a child 4 to 10 years of age. Parents completed an electronic previsit screen, which included somatic 
                         concerns, health risks, and 4 mental health tools (SCARED5, PHQ-2, SDQ Impact, and PSC-17). Parents completed an exit survey, and a subset were 
                         interviewed. All primary care providers (PCPs) were interviewed.
                         <i>RESULTS</i>: A total of 120 parents and 16 PCPs participated. The exit surveys showed that nearly 90% of parents agreed or strongly agreed 
                         that the screener was easy to use and maintained confidentiality. During interviews, parents noted that the screener helped with recall, 
                         validated concerns, reframed issues they thought might not be appropriate for primary care, and raised new questions. PCPs thought that the 
                         screener enabled them to normalize sensitive issues, and it permitted them to simultaneously focus and be comprehensive during the visit. 
                         Parents and PCPs agreed that the screener helped guide discus- sion, promoted in-depth exchange, and increased efficiency. 
                         Findings were consistent across quantitative and qualitative methods and between parents and PCPs.
                         <i>CONCLUSIONS</i>: A comprehensive electronic previsit screening tool is an acceptable and practical strategy to facilitate well-child visits. 
                         It may help with problem identification as well as with setting agendas, engaging the family, and balancing attention between somatic and
                         psychosocial concerns.</p></li>

                         <i>Objective</i>.—The aim of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the parent and youth versions of the 17-item Pediatric Symptom Checklist 
                         (PSC-17) for identifying children with symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). <i>Methods</i>.—Cross-sectional convenience samples of children aged 8 
                         to 10 years treated at a primary care pediatrics practice in New York City were recruited. The PSC-17 and its 5-item internalizing subscale were used in 
                         both parent- and youth-completed formats. Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms were identified with the University of California, Los Angeles posttraumatic 
                         stress reaction index (UCLA RI), used as a structured inter- view with the child.
                         <i>Results</i>.—One hundred fifty-six children enrolled in the study. Twenty-two percent of children met the UCLA RI cutoff for likely PTSD. The youth version 
                         of the PSC-17 and its 5-item internalizing subscale identified these children with sensitivities of 78% and 75% and specificities of 77% and 77%, respectively, 
                         relative to the UCLA RI. The parent version of the PSC-17 and the internalizing subscale had poorer sensitivities of 44% and 25% and similar specificities 
                         of 79% and 92%, respectively. <i>Conclusions</i>.—Symptoms of PTSD can be identified using the youth self-report version of the PSC-17. A 5-item subscale of the PSC-17 
                         also performed well and can readily be used in primary care settings.
