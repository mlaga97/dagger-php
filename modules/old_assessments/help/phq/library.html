                        <i>Background</i>: Although the PHQ-9 is widely used in primary care, little is known about its performance in quantifying improvement. 
                        The original validation study of the PHQ-9 defined clinically significant change as a post-treatment score of ≤9 combined with 
                        improvement of 50%, but it is unclear how this relates to other theoretically informed methods of defining successful outcome. 
                        We compared a range of definitions of clinically significant change (original definition, asymptomatic criterion, reliable and 
                        clinically significant change criteria a, b and c) in a clinical trial of a community-level depression intervention.
                        <i>Method</i>: Randomised Control Trial of collaborative care for depression. Levels of agreement were calculated between the standard definition, 
                        other definitions, and gold-standard diagnostic interview.
                        <i>Results</i>: The standard definition showed good agreement (kappaN0.60) with the other definitions and had moderate, though acceptable, 
                        agreement with the diagnostic interview (kappa = 0.58). The standard definition corresponded closely to reliable and clinically significant 
                        change criterion c, the recommended method of quantifying improvement when clinical and non-clinical distributions overlap.
                        <i>Limitations</i>: The absence of follow-up data meant that an asymptomatic criterion rather than remission or recovery criteria were used.
                        <i>Conclusion</i>: The close agreement between the standard definition and reliable and clinically significant change criterion c provides some 
                        support for the standard definition of improvement. However, it may be preferable to use a reliable change index rather than 50% improvement. 
                        Remission status, based on the asymptomatic range and a lower PHQ-9 score, may provide a useful additional category of clinical change.</p></li>

                        of the PHQ-9 During Routine Screening for Depression</a><p>ABSTRACT - Background: Patients with serious medical illnesses, such as cancer, are at increased risk of suicide but are also often facing death. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) is widely used to screen patients for depression.
                        It includes an item that asks about thoughts of death and hurting yourself (Item-9). Objective: To describe the na- ture of thoughts of death and suicide 
                        reported in clinical interviews carried out to further assess suicidal ideation of cancer outpatients who had endorsed the “suicidal thoughts item” 
                        (Item-9) of the PHQ-9 during routine depression screening. Method: Secondary analysis of anonymized service data (with ethical approval) derived from 
                        the routine clinical administration of self-report questionnaires and telephone interviews to outpatients attending a Cancer Centre in the UK. 
                        Results: Complete data were available on 330/463 (71%) of patients who had endorsed Item-9. In a subsequent structured telephone interview, approximately
                        one-third of these patients denied any thoughts that they would be better off dead, another third acknowledged having thoughts that they would be 
                        better off dead, but not of suicide, and the remaining third re- ported clear thoughts of committing suicide. Conclusion: Only one-third of cancer 
                        outpatients who endorse the “suicidal thoughts item” of the PHQ-9 report suicidal thoughts at a subsequent interview. Services planning to set up 
                        de- pression screening with the PHQ-9 need to carefully consider the relative benefits and burden to their service and patients of including Item-9 
                        and interviewing all those who endorse it.</p></li>
                <li><a href="14000139.pdf" target="_blank">The association between poor dental health and depression: findings from a large-scale, population-based study 
                        (the NHANES study)</a><p>ABSTRACT - <i>Objective</i>: To examine the relationship of poor dental health and depression, controlling for markers 
                        of inflammation (C-reactive protein; CRP) and adiposity (body mass index; BMI).
                        <i>Method</i>: Data from two National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (2005–2008) were utilized (n=10214). Dental health was assessed 
                        using the Oral Health Questionnaire (OHQ). Depression was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), where cases were identified 
                        using a cut off score of 10 or above. Logistic regression was applied to measure magnitude of associations, controlling for a range of covariates 
                        including CRP and BMI.
                        <i>Results</i>: After adjustment for covariates, a significant dose–response relationship between number of oral health conditions and likelihood
                        of PHQ-9 defined depression was observed. Compared with individuals without an oral health condition, adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 
                        for depression in those with two, four and six conditions were 1.60 (1.08–2.38), 2.13 (1.46–3.11) and 3.94 (2.72–5.72), respectively. Level of CRP
                        and being underweight or obese were associated with being depressed.
                        <i>Conclusions</i>: A positive association exists between poor dental health and depression that is independent of CRP and BMI.</p></li>

                        differential item functioning occurs when men and women respond differently to an item despite being similar on the trait assessed by that item. 
                        The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) is a prominent screening tool for depression. Researchers exploring whether the PHQ-9 exhibits 
                        gender- based differential item functioning have used only specialized samples (e.g., individuals with cancer or vision loss). We explored 
                        gender bias in the PHQ-9 by means of differential item functioning analyses in a population-based sample.
We made use of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES, 2008), a population-based sample of the USA including 5995 participants. Differential 
item functioning was assessed using the Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test and by comparing item characteristic curves between men and women.
All items exhibited negligible differential item functioning as demonstrated by the Mantel-Haenszel test, with absolute standardized mean differences ranging from 0.00 to 0.06. 
Item characteristic curves were similar between genders for all but one item. Item 5 (i.e., changes in appetite) exhibited very minor non-uniform differential item 
functioning, wherein extremely depressed women endorsed higher response options on this item compared to equally depressed men.
Researchers can use the PHQ-9 without concern of gender biases, particularly in epidemiological research.</p></li>

                        of Axis-I mood disorders with primary substance use disorders (SUD), it is important to routinely assess substance abusers for evidence of a mood 
                        disorder. The primary goal of the present study was to examine the psychometric characteristics of two widely used self-report measures of depression
                        (Beck Depression Inventory-II; Patient Health Questionnaire PRIME MD) with substance abusers (N = 108) in an outpatient treatment setting. 
                        Using Cronbach's alpha, the reliabilities of the BDI-II and the PHQ-9 were 0.95 and 0.91, respectively. Principal component factor analyses 
                        of both measures were conducted to evaluate the relationship between a 3-factor solution (cognitive, affective, and somatic) for the BDI-II 
                        and a 1-factor solution for the PHQ-9 (depression). Both measures were correlated with severity levels of alcohol and drug use. Advantages 
                        and disadvantages of using both measures with substance abusers are discussed.</p></li>
