                        incidence of and factors associated with the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) 6 months after civilian mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI).
                        <i>Design</i>: Secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial of telephone follow-up versus usual care to reduce MTBI symptoms and improve function.
                        <i>Setting</i>: In-person and telephone interviews.
                        <i>Participants</i>: Prospectively studied participants (N=239) with MTBI enrolled in the emergency department.
                        <i>Interventions</i>: Not applicable.
                        <i>Main Outcome Measures</i>: Secondary analysis with main out- come measure of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist– Civilian Version.
                        <i>Results</i>: At 6 months after MTBI, 17% of participants met criteria for diagnosis of PTSD. Logistic regression predicting PTSD from baseline characteristics 
                        showed that participants who were Hispanic versus white, non-Hispanic and who, at the time of injury, described themselves as less happy and believed 
                        they would be more affected by their injury were significantly more likely to have PTSD.
                        <i>Conclusions</i>: Rates of PTSD in civilian MTBI in this study are consistent with prior research. Results suggest that personality 
                        characteristics and attribution regarding the injury may impact the development of PTSD. Early interventions addressing risk factors 
                        may prevent or reduce the likelihood of developing PTSD.</p></li>

                        with 7 members was formed under the cosponsorship of 5 U.S. federal agencies to identify common data elements for research related to 
                        posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The work group reviewed both previous and contemporary measurement standardization efforts for 
                        PTSD research and engaged in a series of electronic and live discussions to address a set of predefined aims. Eight construct domains relevant to 
                        PTSD were identified: (1) traditional demographics, (2) exposure to stressors and trauma, (3) potential stress moderators, (4) trauma assessment, 
                        (5) PTSD screening, (6) PTSD symptoms and diagnosis, (7) PTSD- related functioning and disability, and (8) mental health history.
                        Measures assigned to the core data elements category have relatively low time-and-effort costs in order to make them potentially 
                        applicable across a wide range of studies for which PTSD is a relevant condition. Measures assigned to the supplemental data elements 
                        category have greater costs but generally demonstrate stronger psychometric performance and provide more extensive information. Accordingly, measures 
                        designated as supplemental are recommended instead of or in addition to corresponding core measures whenever resources and study design allow. 
                        The work group offered 4 caveats that highlight potential limitations and emphasize the voluntary nature of standardization for PTSD-related measurement.</p></li>
                <li><a href="200440X.pdf" target="_blank">Relationship Between Pain and Post-Traumatic Stress Symptoms in Palliative Care</a><p>ABSTRACT - <i>Context</i>. Previous research suggests that 
                        patients receiving palliative care may simultaneously experience poorly managed pain and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-related symptoms as a result of their 
                        deteriorating health.
                        <i>Objectives</i>. To: 1) examine predictors of PTSD-related symptoms in patients requiring palliative care; 2) assess whether anxiety, depression, pain catastrophizing, and pain anxiety mediate the 
                        relationship between pain interference and PTSD-related symptoms; and 3) evaluate the impact of these variables on pain interference and PTSD-related symptoms.
                        <i>Methods</i>. One hundred patients receiving palliative care at one of two palliative care sites in London, ON, Canada, completed the PTSD Checklist--Civilian version (PCL-C), 
                        the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF), and the Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale-20 (PASS-20).
                        Hierarchical multiple regressions were used to examine HADS-Anxiety, HADS-Depression, PCS and PASS-20 scores as predictors of PCL-C scores; and mediation analyses were used to test
                        the effect of HADS-Anxiety, HADS-Depression, PCS, and PASS-20 on the relationship between BPI-SF interference and PCL-C. Mediators that significantly affected this relationship in the 
                        individual mediator models were entered into a multiple mediator model.
                        <i>Results</i>. Only pain anxiety and pain catastrophizing emerged as significant mediators of the relationship between pain interference and PTSD-related symptoms. 
                        After being entered in a multiple mediator model, pain anxiety emerged as the strongest mediator.
                        <i>Conclusion</i>. The findings of the present study reveal that pain and PTSD-related symptoms are important concerns in palliative care, and that pain must be 
                        addressed to best meet the needs of this population.</p></li>

                        Follow­up Study in Secondary School Students in the Wenchuan Earthquake Region</a><p>ABSTRACT - <i>Objective</i>: To analyze the sensitivity of effect factors between 
                        the PCL‐C and the SCL‐90, to provide
                        evidence for social psychological crisis screening and post‐trauma interventions.
                        <i>Methods</i>: We administered the PCL‐C and SCL‐90 to screen for PTSD and other psychological problems among students who survived the disaster and continued their school studies. 
                        The surveys were carried out 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the earthquake. A bivariate 2‐level logistic model was used to explore the different levels of sensitivity among students. 
                        The factors influencing the relationships between PTSD and depression, and between PTSD and anxiety were examined.
                        <i>Results</i>: We analyzed data from 1 677 students, revealing that female students in higher grades were more likely to exhibit symptoms of depression, rather than PTSD, 
                        compared with the control group (males in lower grades), and the difference was significant (P<0.05). In contrast, ethnic minorities were more likely to exhibit PTSD symptoms 
                        compared to the others. In addition, female students were more likely to exhibit symptoms of anxiety than PTSD. Other effects that did not reach statistical significance were suggested to have a 
                        similar influence on PTSD, depression, and anxiety.
                        <i>Conclusion</i>: After a natural disaster, specific aspects of depression and anxiety should be examined, avoiding an overemphasis on PTSD in social psychological crisis interventions.</p></li>
                <li><a href="7006843.pdf" target="_blank">Mental health of female survivors of human trafficking in Nepal</a><p>ABSTRACT - Little is known about the mental health status of trafficked women, 
                        even though international conventions require that it be con- sidered. This study, therefore, aims at exploring the mental health status, including anxiety, depression and post-traumatic 
                        stress disorder (PTSD), of female survivors of human trafficking who are currently supported by local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Katmandu, the capital of Nepal, through 
                        comparison between those who were forced to work as sex workers and those who worked in other areas such as domestic and circus work (non-sex workers group). The Hopkins Symptoms Checklist-25 (HSCL-25)
                        was administered to assess anxiety and depression, and the PTSD Checklist Civilian Version (PCL-C) was used to eval- uate PTSD. Both the sex workers’ and the non-sex workers’ groups 
                        had a high proportion of cases with anxiety, depression, and PTSD. The sex workers group tended to have more anxiety symptoms (97.7%) than the non-sex workers group (87.5%). Regarding depression, 
                        all the constituents of the sex workers group scored over the cut-off point (100%), and the group showed a significantly higher prevalence than the non-sex workers (80.8%). The proportion of those who are above 
                        the cut-off for PTSD was higher in the sex workers group (29.6%) than in the non-sex workers group (7.5%). There was a higher rate of HIV infection in the sex workers group (29.6%) than in the non-sex workers 
                        group (0%). The findings suggest that programs to address human trafficking should include interventions (such as psychosocial support) to improve survivors’ mental health status, paying attention to the 
                        category of work performed during the trafficking period. In particular, the current efforts of the United Nations and various NGOs that help survivors of human trafficking need to more explicitly 
                        focus on mental health and psychosocial support.</p></li>
                <li><a href="8003771.pdf" target="_blank">Pharmacologic alternatives to antidepressants in posttraumatic stress disorder: A systematic review</a><p>ABSTRACT - The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are 
                        considered the first-line pharmacological treatment for PTSD. However, even when treated with this class of drugs, response rates rarely exceed 60% and less than 20–30% of the patients 
                        achieve full remission. The aim of this study was to address this limitation by systematically reviewing the options left for the treatment of PTSD when patients do not respond satisfactorily to or 
                        tolerate SSRIs. A systematic review covering all original articles, letters and brief reports published in any language until October 2008 was conducted through searches in the ISI/Web of 
                        Science, PubMed and PILOTS databases. The search terms included the pharmacological class of each agent or its generic name plus “PTSD” or “stress disorder” in the title, in the abstract or as 
                        a keyword. Sixty-three articles were selected, covering the following categories: antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, adrenergic-inhibiting agents, opioid antagonists, benzodiazepines and other 
                        agents. None of the identified agents reached the level A of scientific evidence, 5 reached level B, 7 level C and 13 level D. The non-antidepressant agent with the strongest scientific evidence
                        supporting its use in PTSD is risperidone, which can be envisaged as an effective add-on therapy when patients did not fully benefit from previous treatment with SSRIs. Prazosin, an adrenergic-inhibiting agent,
                        is a promising alternative for cases of PTSD where nightmares and insomnia are prominent symptoms. So far, there is no consistent empirical support for using benzodiazepines in the prevention or in the treatment of PTSD, 
                        although these drugs could alleviate some associated non-specific symptoms, such as insomnia or anxiety. Further controlled clinical trials and meta-analysis are needed to guide clinicians in their 
                        search of effective pharmacological alternatives to antidepressants in PTSD.</p></li>
