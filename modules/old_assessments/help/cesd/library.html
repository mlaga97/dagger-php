                        the factorial invariance of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies of Depression Scale (CES-D) across gender and time during adolescence. The factor structure of the CES-D was compared at four annual 
                        measurement waves in a community sample of 2650 Australian adolescents. Confirmatory factor analyses showed that the factor structure of the CES-D was generally invariant across gender and time. 
                        However, gender differences were found on three items: for all waves the item ‘I had crying spells’ was a stronger indicator for depressive affect in females than males. On the final three waves 
                        the item ‘people were unfriendly’ loaded significantly higher on the factor ‘Interpersonal Relations’ for males than females. On Wave 2 and 3 males interpreted the item ‘everything I did was an effort’ 
                        with a positive connotation, whereas females interpret it with a negative association. These gender-differences are discussed from both a theoretical and a methodological perspective.</p></li>

                        important public health outcome in the older adult population. It is associated with declining physical and psychological well-being and increasing healthcare utilisation. The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) 
                        although widely accepted as a screening tool for depressive symptoms in older adults, can be long and exhaustive as part of a comprehensive geriatric assessment.
                        <i>Aim</i>: We investigated the consistency, reliability and validity of the original and three short formats of the CES-D.
                        <i>Methods</i>: Six thousand six hundred and thirty-seven community-living adults, aged 50 years from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA), completed the 20-item CES-D. Confirmatory factor analysis determined
                        the factor structures of the 20-, 10- and two 8-item formats of the CES-D. Latent factors from each format were validated against disability and perceived stress, particularly the Positive Affect factor. Analysis was also 
                        performed in a subset aged 65+ years.
                        <i>Results</i>: All formats of the CES-D displayed good internally consistency (0.87–0.72) and good model fit for the expected four- and three-factor structures of the CES-D. Latent factors from all formats 
                        were representative of each other and the Positive Affect factor was negatively correlated with disability and perceived stress on all CES-D formats.
                        <i>Conclusion</i>: Short forms of the CES-D are consistent, reliable and valid for use in the older adult population (50+ or 65+ years), where avoiding long assessments and response fatigue is warranted. 
                        These formats may be used to measure Positive Affect, an important construct related to physical health, resilience and psychological well-being in later life.</p></li>
                <li><a href="9000045.pdf" target="_blank">Measurement of depressive symptoms in cancer patients: Evaluation of the Center for Epidemiological studies depression scale (CES-D)</a><p> ABSTRACT - The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) 
                        is commonly used to measure depressive symptomatology in cancer patients, yet there is little known about the psychometric properties of the measure when applied to a cancer population. The aim of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of the
                        CES-D with cancer patients. For purposes of comparison, the psychometric properties of the CES-D were assessed both in women undergoing treatment for breast cancer and women with no history of cancer. The CES-D and other study measures were administered to 
                        women undergoing treatment for breast cancer on two occasions: prior to treatment and midway through treatment. The measures were also administered to a group of women similar in age to the cancer patients who had no history of any type of cancer. These 
                        healthy comparison subjects were also assessed on two separate occasions. The CES-D was found to have good internal consistency, with alpha coefficients 0.85 for both groups, as well as adequate test–retest reliability in both groups. Construct validity 
                        was demonstrated in two ways, via comparisons between the groups and by comparing the CES-D with measures of fatigue, anxiety, and global mental health functioning. The CES-D was established as a valid and reliable measure of depressive symptomatology in 
                        this sample of breast cancer patients. This measure may be appropriate for use in clinical psychosocial research with cancer patients, yet further research is needed to evaluate its usefulness in other cancer populations. The importance of measuring 
                        psychological symptoms with standard measures that have been validated with cancer patients is highlighted.</p></li>
                <li><a href="v01n3p385.pdf" target="_blank">The CES-D Scale: A Self-Report Depression Scale for Research in the General Population</a><p> ABSTRACT - The CES-D scale is a short self-report scale designed to measure depressive symptomatology in the general population. 
                    The items of the scale are symptoms associated with depression which have been used in previously validated longer scales. The new scale was tested in household interview surveys and in psychiatric settings. It was found to have very high internal consistency 
                    and adequate test- retest repeatability. Validity was established by patterns of correlations with other self-report measures, by correlations with clinical ratings of depression, and by relationships with other variables which support its construct validity. 
                    Reliability, validity, and factor structure were similar across a wide variety of demographic characteristics in the general population samples tested. The scale should be a useful tool for epidemiologic studies of depression.</p></li>
