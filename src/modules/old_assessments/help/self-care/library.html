                        Detemir, a Long-Acting Insulin Analog</a><p>ABSTRACT -  Insulin detemir is a long-acting basal insulin approved for use in patients with type 1 (T1DM) or type 2 diabetes (T2DM). 
                        Insulin detemir has demonstrated equivalent glycemic control and hypoglycemic risk when compared to insulin glargine, and insulin detemir has generally but not consistently 
                        demonstrated less weight gain than insulin glargine in T2DM. The benefits of basal insulin analogs relative to NPH insulin are well recognized, including less FBG variability, 
                        lower risk of hypoglycemia, and less weight gain specifically with insulin detemir. However, NPH insulin continues to be widely prescribed, which may be due in part to economic considerations. 
                        While NPH insulin generally costs less per prescription, insulin detemir has been shown to be cost effective compared to NPH insulin as well as insulin glargine. Therefore, 
                        insulin detemir is an effective option from both clinical and economic perspectives for patients with T1DM or T2DM who require basal insulin to achieve glycemic control.</p></li>

                        goal of the guideline is to improve the quality of care and the outcome in people with type 2 diabetes in low-resource settings. It recommends a set of basic interventions to integrate 
                        management of diabetes into primary health care. It will serve as basis for development of simple algorithms for use by health care staff in primary care in low-resource settings, 
                        to reduce the risk of acute and chronic complications of diabetes.
                    </p><p>The guideline was developed by a group of external and WHO experts, following the WHO process of guideline development. GRADE methodology was used to assess
                        the quality of evidence and decide the strength of the recommendations.</p></li>

                    </a><p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY INTRODUCTION- Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. This life-threatening 
                        addiction usually begins in childhood; 80-90% of adult smokers begin smoking between ages 12 and 14. If current tobacco use patterns 
                        persist, an estimated 6.4 million youth who smoke will eventually die prematurely from a smoking- related disease. In Virginia specifically, 
                        approximately 15.5% of high school students smoke, and it is projected that of all Virginian children currently under 18, 
                        approximately 152,000 will die prematurely from smoking.</p></li>
                <li><a href="HSI-Behavioral-Interventions.pdf" target="_blank">Behavioral Interventions Associated with smoking cessation in the Treatment of Tobacco Use</a><p>Abstract: 
                        Tobacco smoke is the leading cause of preventable premature death worldwide. While the majority of smokers would like to stop, the habitual and addictive 
                        nature of smoking makes cessation difficult. Clinical guidelines suggest that smoking cessation inter- ventions should include both behavioural support 
                        and pharmacotherapy (e.g. nicotine replacement therapy). This commentary paper focuses on the important role of behavioural interventions in encouraging 
                        and supporting smoking cessation attempts. Recent develop- ments in the field are discussed, including ‘cut-down to quit’, the behaviour change techniques 
                        taxonomy (BCTT) and very brief advice (VBA) on smoking. The paper concludes with a discussion of the important role that health professionals can and should 
                        play in the delivery of smoking cessation interventions.</p></li>
